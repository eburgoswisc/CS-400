## Inner classes

* A class defined in another class:
    * Why is this good? Lets say you make a class that holds multiple datastructures that are closely related, then you might as well have it in one file.

    * One way: private class and all its members are private
    * Fact: members of both classes have access to each other
    * you dont need getters and setters if its an **inner** class.
##### Define a generic class using an inner class

```java

public class Tree<K extends Comparable<K>> {
    private class Treenode<K> {
        private K data;
        private ListADT(Treenode<K>) children;

        private Treenode(K data) {
            // blah blah
        }

        private K getData() { return data;}
    } // inner

    private Treenode<K> root;
    private int size;

    public Tree(...) {
        this.root = new Treenode<String>();
        .
        .
        .

        root.data =
        root.children =

    }
}
```

### Tree

##### Height
1. No nodes is h = 0
2. 1 node is h = 1

* We count it by nodes.

##### Write a recursive definition for the height of a general Tree
    **Pseudocode**
    height of a tree:
        if t is null, return 0
        if t has no children, return 1
        return 1 + max(height(leftChild), height(rightChild))
    return 1 + max(height(left), height(right))

```java
public int height() {
    // Finish the method
    if (root == null) {return 0;}
    else {return recursiveHeight(root);}

}

private int recursiveHeight(Treenode<K> current) {
    if (current == null) {return 0;} // base case
    return 1 + max(recursiveHeight(current.left), recursiveHeight(current.right));
}
```

```sequence
Alice->Bob
```
