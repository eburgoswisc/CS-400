## Inner classes

* A class defined in another class:
    * Why is this good? Lets say you make a class that holds multiple datastructures that are closely related, then you might as well have it in one file.

    * One way: private class and all its members are private
    * Fact: members of both classes have access to each other
    * you dont need getters and setters if its an **inner** class.
##### Define a generic class using an inner class

```java

public class Tree<K extends Comparable<K>> {
    private class Treenode<K> {
        private K data;
        private ListADT(Treenode<K>) children;

        private Treenode(K data) {
            // blah blah
        }

        private K getData() { return data;}
    } // inner

    private Treenode<K> root;
    private int size;

    public Tree(...) {
        this.root = new Treenode<String>();
        .
        .
        .

        root.data =
        root.children =

    }
}
```
