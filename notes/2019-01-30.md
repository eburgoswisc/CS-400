## Test Program Structure (P1)
* One test class for each data implementation being tested
* Write black-box unit test
    * You cannot see the code.
* Have a main method to run all the tests
* Tests should be independent from each other.

### Test Implementations of a single DataStructureADT

* Define a test super class
* Add an abstract method that creates and returns an instance of ADT type, (createInstance)
* Place all tests in the super class.
* Define a subclass of the test super class for each datatype you want to test
* Define the abstract create method in each sub-type

## Java Inner Classes

* A class defined within another class
* making inner class *private*, makes memebers of inner class also *private*.

```java
public class Tree<K extends Comparable<K>> {
    private class Treenode <K> {
        private K data;
        private ListADT<Treenode<K>> children;
        //private constructor and methods ...
    }
    private Treenode<K> root;
    private int size;

    public Tree() {...}
    add()
    remove()
    ...
}
```

* The inner class **does not get initialized** because you have not actually created anything from it. Instantiating the super *outer* class does no initialize *inner*.

### Height of a tree or sub-Tree

* Its defined by the number of nodes from root to deepest leaf.

* Write a recursive function to find height of tree.

```Java

height(Tree t)

    // Base cases
    h = 0, if root is null
    h = 1, if root is a leaf

    // Recursive case
    h = 1 + max height of all children, if root is not a leaf

public int height() {
    if (root == null) return 0;
    else return height(root);
}

private int height(Treenode<T> node) {

}
```

### P1 explanation

* We have been given DataStructures and now we make test cases.
