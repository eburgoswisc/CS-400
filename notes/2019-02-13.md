## Red-Black Trees

### Inserting into RB Tree

- Use BST insert, check 3 properties, fix

```java
if (T is empty) {
    myTree.root = 50;
}

if (T is not empty) {
    super.insert() // Insert method of BST
    // Set node to red
    // check the 3 properties and fix
}
```

- Which of the properties might be violated by inserting a red node?
  
1. **root property**: nothing happens
2. **black property**: will not cause problem, we inserted a red leaf.
3. **red property**: cannot have a red child

- Fix depends in parent's sibling. 

### Fixing a RBT

Tri-node Restructuring if p's sibling is Black or null.
    - Find median of g, p , k.
    - Color the median black
    - Make the median new parent of other two
    - Children will be red.
  
Recoloring is done if p's sibling is red:
    - change p and s to black
    - change g to red only unless its the root.
    - Check g parents for red violation through recursive callback
