## Balanced Search Trees

### Goal:

    - Maintain a Binary Search Tree with a height that stays O(logN) as it grows.

### Idea:

    - After we insert or delete identify nodes out of balance, fix by re-arranging the nodes

#### How to do this?

- Use binary seach tree code
- in the insert method
    - After insert, check size, calculate height of each subtree (getHeight())
    - If height(left) - height(right) does not equal [1,0,-1] there is a problem.
    - **fix** by rotating nodes

#### Balance Factor: for CS 400, we will define

`BF = height(Leftsubtree) - height(rightsubtree)`

- Will use recursive get height
- Leaves are equally balanced at 0
